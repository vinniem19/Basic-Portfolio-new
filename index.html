        Hello. My name is Vinnie Miller. I am a website developer. I learned my skills from UCF's Web Coding Bootcamp. I
        have always loved roller coasters.
        My favorite in Florida is the Montu at Busch Gardens. Overall, the best roller coaster I have been on is the
        Millenium Force at Cedar Point in Ohio.
        I enjoy playing cards and working on puzzles in my free time. Growing up, my family always played this card game
        called Shang Hai. It consisted of
        seven rounds of play, with the objective to be the player with the least amount of points at the end of the
        game. If you decide to play, though, be
        prepared to spend 1-2 hours playing the game.

        I have recently started doing puzzles. The puzzles I find most
        challenging are the photomosaics. My
        family and I have completed two Disney Photomosaics and are working on a third.

        I love theme parks. Everything about them is cool. Well, maybe I don't enjoy the lines. For me, the excitement
        begins when I can see the bilboards as we
        drive down the road. As we get closer, I start to notice the rides and attractions. The fun really sets in as we
        go through the entrance gate.
        Immediately, we are immersed in a world that is secluded from outside interferences. Heeart-pounding thrill
        rides are in sight. The energy from the
        theme park employees surrounds me. We then look at the map to start planning our day.
